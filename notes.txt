## Pre-Configured Settings:
- `user.name = SITHIKALI`
- `user.email = sithikali2000@.com`

Customize `.devcontainer/git-preconfig.sh` for your needs.

Creating A New Repo

cd /path/to/new
mkdir my-first-git-repo
cd my-first-git-repo

git init

The Files Are IN the Git Repo
Every git repo comes with a directory that contains all of the state of the git repo. This repo is found in .git

âžœ  my-first-git git:(master) find .git

The Basics

The next couple commands will be 80% of the commands you will execute when using git. 80% of git is exceptionally easy. Its the 20% that can get you into trouble :7


    git add <path-to-file | pattern> will add zero or more files to the index (staging area)
    git commit -m '<message>' will commit what changes are present in the index.
    git status will describe the state of your git repo which will include tracked, staged, and untracked changes.
